If we continue in this way, there would be no need for nuclear power plants. Perhaps, the only reason nuclear power plants are preferred is because they are more profitable compared to other forms of power generation."

女性は現実的で、冷静に男を分析する、と言うか、分析を怠らないけど、男は女に対して幻想を抱き、分析を怠って女性の嘘を見抜けない。男の嘘ばかりが相手に見抜かれがちなのはそのせいじゃないかな。,"Women are practical and analyze men calmly, or rather, they never neglect analysis.

Perhaps it's because men's lies are more likely to be exposed by their counterparts."

合併や政令市になることも､自立が一番の目標だという。その一方では､県や国からの補助金や交付金を口を開けて待っているのが現実である。これらを覚醒するには橋本市長の言うとおり、消費税の地方税化が何よりの妙薬である。,"The goal is to achieve independence, even through mergers or becoming a designated city. On the other hand, the reality is that they are eagerly awaiting subsidies and grants from the prefecture and national government. To address this issue, as Mayor Hashimoto suggests, the localization of the consumption tax is the ultimate remedy."

京都のタクシーは、一日の走行距離が250kmまでという規制があることを皆さんご存知ですか？オーバーする場合は、250km以内に乗客を降ろすそうです。なんか矛盾です。京都は人口比率からタクシーが多いそうです。,"Do you all know that there is a regulation in Kyoto that restricts taxis to a maximum daily distance of 250km? If they exceed this limit, they are supposed to drop off passengers within 250 kilometers. It seems contradictory, doesn't it? It is said that there are many taxis in Kyoto due to the population ratio."
