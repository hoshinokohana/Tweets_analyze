島唄は、恋愛ソングでは無く戦争の(一人の人への)歌だった。一部沖縄音階を使わないのは彼女が本国の犠牲だと言う思いだそうだ。もっとも、戦争の犠牲は沖縄だけでは無いけど一番激しかった事は学校でも教わった。改めて聴くと涙が出る。私達戦争を知らない世代がいかに幸せであるかを思い知った。,"""Shimauta"" was not a love song, but a song about war (dedicated to a particular person). It seems that the reason she didn't use some Okinawan scales is because she wanted to convey the sacrifice of her homeland. However, it is important to note that the sacrifices of war were not limited to Okinawa, but it was taught as being the most severe in school. When I listen to it again, tears flow.

j・p・ホーガン 「星を継ぐもの」「ガニメデの優しい巨人」に続き「巨人たちの星」を一気に読んだ。1983年発表の本格派SF作品。世界中が軍縮に向かい希望に満ちていた時代だったためか、人類を見つめる眼差しは楽観的であたたかい。人類は捨てたもんじゃないな。,"I read ""Giant's Star"" in one go, following J.P. Hogan's ""Inherit the Stars"" and ""The Gentle Giants of Ganymede"". It's a serious science fiction work published in 1983. Perhaps because it was a time when the world was heading towards disarmament and filled with hope, the perspective on humanity was optimistic and warm. Humanity is not a lost cause."

I went around the stalls at the Shanshan Festival. I'm taking the train back to my parents' house to drink alcohol.

But maybe it's because I'm just an ordinary person that I don't have anything I love more than that. Or maybe it's because I've become an adult.

ぁ、「本能的に窮屈」なのと、「自分がつくってる制限やブレーキで窮屈」なのも、違う☆  「合わない」って言葉は、一般的に（無意識にだけど）後者のイメージが強い気がする。  「合わない」と「嫌い」は違う☆  「合わない」は存在を認めてるけど、「嫌い」は否定してるから☆,"Ah, ""instinctively uncomfortable"" and ""restrictions or brakes that I impose on myself making me uncomfortable"" are different things. The word ""合わない"" (awananai) generally has a stronger connotation of the latter (unconsciously). ""合わない"" (awananai) and ""嫌い"" (kirai) are different. ""合わない"" (awananai) acknowledges the existence, while ""嫌い"" (kirai) negates it."

さしあたって経産省の信頼を回復するどころか、酷い価格設定という結果を導き、経産省のさらなる権威失墜と再生可能エネルギーの普及を阻害することになる。利益相反の経団連と失われた10年を導き責任をとらない御用学者を認めるのか、そうならないように国会議員に期待しなきゃいけない。,"Rather than restoring trust in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), this will result in a severe pricing policy that hampers the further adoption of renewable energy and further undermines the authority of METI. Are we going to accept scholars who are beholden to conflicting interests and have led us into a lost decade without taking responsibility, or do we have to rely on members of parliament to prevent this from happening?"
